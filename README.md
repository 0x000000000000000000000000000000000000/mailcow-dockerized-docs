# mailcow-docs-2.0
The rework of the official mailcow docs

### Introduction:
The new 2.0 version of the mailcow documentation has been redesigned from scratch based on the original.

Advantages compared to the 1.0 version:
- Full translation support (English and German are officially supported by Servercow/tinc).
- New folder structure for better overview/ordering of sub-pages.

Due to the fact that this version now has some serious changes compared to the 1.0 version, all pending merge requests are no longer compatible with this version.
