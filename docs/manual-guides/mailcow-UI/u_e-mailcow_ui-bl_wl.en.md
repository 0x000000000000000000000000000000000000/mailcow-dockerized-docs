To add or edit an entry to your **domain-wide** filter table, log in to your *mailcow UI* as (domain) administrator and go to: 
`Configuration > Email Setup > Domains > Edit Domain > Spam Filter`.

!!! info
    Be aware that a user can override this [setting](u_e-mailcow_ui-spamfilter.en.md) by setting their own blacklist and whitelist!

There is also a global filter table in `Configuration > Configuration & Details > Global filter maps` to configure a **server wide** filter for multiple regex maps (todo: screenshots).
