Since February the 28th 2017 mailcow does come with port 80 and 443 enabled.

Open `mailcow.conf` and set `HTTP_BIND=0.0.0.0` - if not already set.

Open `data/conf/nginx/site.conf` and add a new site at the top of that file:

```
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;
  include /etc/nginx/conf.d/server_name.active;
  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

In case you changed the HTTP_BIND parameter, recreate the container:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Otherwise restart Nginx:

```
docker-compose restart nginx-mailcow
```
